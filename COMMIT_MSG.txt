feat: Add P2P chat and file transfer applications

Add two new peer-to-peer applications built on Altair's NAT traversal:

**P2P Chat Application (altair-chat)**
- Terminal-based chat client with colored output
- Supports manual peer connection (initiator/responder modes)
- Message types: TEXT, JOIN, LEAVE, PING/PONG for keepalive
- Message history with configurable max messages
- Terminal UI helpers for cursor control and message formatting
- Commands: /quit, /clear, /status, /help
- Placeholder for signaling server integration

**P2P File Transfer Application (altair-transfer)**
- Send and receive files directly between peers
- Chunked transfer protocol (64KB chunks)
- SHA-256 hash verification for file integrity
- Progress tracking with ETA and transfer speed
- Terminal progress bar visualization
- Interactive file acceptance prompt
- Supports files up to 10GB
- Placeholder for signaling server integration

**Package Structure:**
- `backend/pkg/chat/`: Chat protocol implementation with session management
- `backend/pkg/transfer/`: File transfer protocol with sender/receiver logic
- `backend/cmd/chat/`: Chat CLI application entry point
- `backend/cmd/transfer/`: File transfer CLI application entry point

Both applications support manual TCP connection mode and are designed
to integrate with Altair's hole punching system for NAT traversal.
